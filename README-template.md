## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to get more-or-less correct font size from image using image editor and the ways to make radio/checkboxes appear as simple buttons.

### Continued development

Vanilla JS appears to have much more power than when I first time touched it. That's a new resource of challenges!
